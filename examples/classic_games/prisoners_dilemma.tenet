// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// PRISONER'S DILEMMA
// The most famous game in game theory.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Story:
//   Two criminals are interrogated separately.
//   Each can Cooperate (stay silent) or Defect (rat out partner).
//
// The Tragedy:
//   Mutual cooperation is best for both.
//   But individual incentives drive both to defect.
//
// This pattern appears EVERYWHERE:
//   - Arms races, climate change, overfishing
//   - Price wars, doping in sports, tax evasion
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Payoff parameters (tweak these to explore variants)
var reward = 3;       // Mutual cooperation
var temptation = 5;   // I defect, you cooperate
var sucker = 0;       // I cooperate, you defect
var punishment = 1;   // Mutual defection
