// ARMS RACE
// Two nations spend on weapons. Both end up poorer, equally safe.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Setup:
//   - Two countries choose to Arm or Disarm
//   - Arming is expensive but provides security
//   - If both arm, they're as safe as before but poorer
//   - If one disarms alone, they're vulnerable
//
// Classic example: Cold War between USA and USSR
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
