# Founder Proof: Game-Theoretic Case for Fawaz Ishola

This folder contains Tenet programs that model game-theoretic arguments
for why Fawaz Ishola is the optimal founder for Atlas.

## The Arguments

| File | Game Theory Concept | Claim |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| `01_signaling_game.tenet` | Spence Signaling | Building a DSL is an unfakeable capability signal |
| `02_screening_game.tenet` | Stiglitz Screening | Pre-passed all investor due diligence tests |
| `03_mechanism_design.tenet` | Hurwicz Mechanism Design | Can design tools for novel problems |
| `04_compound_returns.tenet` | Mathematical Compounding | Youth + runway = 8x more expected value |
| `05_obsession_signal.tenet` | Costly Signaling | Irrational dedication proves persistence |
| `06_complete_argument.tenet` | Synthesis | All arguments in one file |

## Run the Complete Argument

```bash
java -cp out org.axiom.tenet.Tenet examples/founder_proof/06_complete_argument.tenet
```

## The Thesis

> **Traditional pitch:** "Trust me, I can execute."
>
> **This approach:** "Here's the computational proof that I'm the optimal founder."

The Axiom stack (Tenet, Flux, Axiom OS) isn't just a portfolio project.
It's a **game-theoretic signal** that creates a separating equilibrium —
distinguishing genuine technical founders from pretenders.

## For Investors

This folder demonstrates:
1. **Technical depth** — Game theory modeled in a custom DSL
2. **First-principles thinking** — Using economics to argue for founder selection
3. **Meta-level capability** — Using the tool to prove the toolmaker
4. **Obsession** — Who else builds game theory proofs of their own capability?
