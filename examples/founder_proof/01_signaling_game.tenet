// SIGNALING GAME: Why Building a DSL Proves Technical Capability
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Based on Michael Spence's Job Market Signaling (Nobel Prize 2001)
//
// The insight: Credentials don't directly teach skills.
// They SIGNAL capability because only capable people can obtain them.
//
// Building a programming language at 19 is the ultimate costly signal.
