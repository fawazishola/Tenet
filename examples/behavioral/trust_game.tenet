// TRUST GAME
// Investor sends money (which triples). Trustee decides return.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The Setup:
//   - Investor has $10, can send $0 or $10
//   - Money sent is TRIPLED ($10 becomes $30)
//   - Trustee decides how much to return
//
// This is the foundation of all credit/banking systems.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
